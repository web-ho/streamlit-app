This is an ongoing project. In first phase we had a plan to simply classify images of birds. For the second phase we will be using openai's api to answer questions regarding the species identified.

This project classifies 25 Indian Bird Species found throughout the country. For now we are only classifying images, later we will extend this project to work in real_time and also give important information related to the species. And other cool facts.

We will also add more indian bird species.
